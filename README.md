# Dataset
This classification problem involves predicting whether a client will subscribe ('yes') or not ('no') to a term deposit, making it a binary classification task. Machine learning techniques can be employed to analyze historical data and build a predictive model to assist the bank in targeting its marketing efforts more effectively.

We tried as a team to analyze data of [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) based on this features

- age: The age of the bank client.
- job: Type of job, categorized as "admin.," "unknown," "unemployed," "management," "housemaid," "entrepreneur," "student," "blue-collar," "self-employed," "retired" "technician," or "services.".
- marital: Marital status.
- education: Educational level.
- default: Binary indicator of whether the client has credit in default ("yes" or "no").
- housing: Binary indicator of whether the client has a housing loan ("yes" or "no").
- loan: Binary indicator of whether the client has a personal loan ("yes" or "no").
- contact_type: Type of contact communication.
- month: Last contact month of the year.
- day_of_week: Day of the week when the last contact was made..
- last_contact_duration: Duration of the last contact in seconds.
- campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign for the client.
- passed_days: Number of days that passed since the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (-1 means the client was not previously contacted).
- previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign for the client.
- previous_outcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign.
- employment_variation_rate: Quarterly indicator of employment variation rate.
- consumer_price_index: Monthly indicator of the consumer price index.
- consumer_confidence_index: Monthly indicator of the consumer confidence index.
- euribor3m: Daily indicator of the Euribor 3-month rate.
- number_of_employees: Quarterly indicator of the number of employees.
- y: Target: Binary indicator of whether the client has subscribed to a term deposit ("yes" or "no").


## Applied Models
